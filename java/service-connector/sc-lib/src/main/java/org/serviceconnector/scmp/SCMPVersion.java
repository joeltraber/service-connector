/**
 * Provides actual SCMP version and method to check compatibility. The SCMP version schema follows this philosophy <br />
 *
 * <pre>
 * 	9.9 (E.g. 2.4)<br />
 *  | | <br />
 *  | +-- version number<br />
 *  +-- release number<br />
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * Release number designates the major release (design) of the protocol. It starts at 1 and is incremented by 1. New protocol is by definition not compatible with the old one. E.g.
 * if the release number is not the same an error occurs.
 * <p>
 * Version number designates the minor improvements of the protocol. It starts at 0 and is incremented by 1. New versions may contain additional features and are compatible. E.g.
 * 2.(x+1) is compatible with V2.(x) but not the other way round.<br />
 * <br />
 * Handling of the SCMP Version in a network hierarchy works according to the following rules and restrictions. The components supporting a SCMP Version have to follow the top down
 * restrictions. This means the requester is able to connect to components supporting equal or higher protocol version. In other words server and SC on level zero have to support
 * equal or higher SCMP Version than connecting clients. Clients and Proxies may connect using older versions.<br>
 * <br>
 * In the context of a session service request the server has to respond with protocol version given in the request. Protocol version is received from the client and nowhere
 * changes for the whole communication flow. In the context of a publish service the server has to publish messages with protocol version compatible to the clients version (lowest
 * version in field). For example the server supports SCMP Version 1.3 and connected clients version 1.2 the server has to publish with version 1.2. Otherwise clients are not able
 * to receive messages. Fault messages from the SC to the server may have version 1.2 even if SC and Server support 1.3. This happens because supported protocol version number of
 * the server is unknown for the SC. In conclusion components supporting an SCMP Version have to implement the matching rules and version logic properly in any case.<br>
 * See the SC_0_SCMP_E.PDF for more details.
