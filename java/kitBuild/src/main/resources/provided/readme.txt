 Installation and verification:
 ------------------------------
 0. Make sure you have installed all required products
 1. Extract the kit into directory of your choice, preserve its structure
 2. Make sure no other application is using ports 7000, 9000, 81, 8080
 3. Invoke bin/start-sc.bat (or .sh on unix/linux platforms)
 4. Invoke bin/start-demo-server.bat (or .sh on unix/linux platforms)
 5. Invoke bin/start-demo-client.bat (or .sh on unix/linux platforms)
 6. Avait the termination of all started components.
 7. Verify the created log files: 
 				logs/demo-client/client.log
 				logs/demo-server/server.log
 				logs/sc/sc.log
 		"ERROR" must not appear here, "WARN" are possible.
 8. Congratulation, you have successfully installed the sc!


 Software upgrade
 ----------------
 If you made changes to the SC configurations, then preserve these files before upgrade. 
 The upgrade is simply done by extracting the kit file into a directory of the 
 previous installation. 
 For compatibility rules see SC_0_SCMP_E.PDF Chapter "scVersion" included in sc-src_V9.9-999.zip


 Software removal
 ----------------
 1. Stop the running SC
 2. Find directories configured in sc.properties or logback configuration file as:
 			- the log directory
 			- the root.pidPath
 			- the root.dumpPath
 			- the cache.diskPath
		Delete these directories
 3. Delete the directory where you have extracted the SC kit file.


 Release notes:
 --------------
	See doc/Open_Issues.xls inside the develoment kit


 Special configurations:
 -----------------------
- logging properties are configured for troubleshooting purposes and may produce large files
- the SC is configured by sc.properties: http=localhost:7000 tcp=localhost:9000
- demo-client is hardcoded connect to port 7000
- demo-server is hardcoded connect to port 9000
