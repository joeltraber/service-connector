SC Feature List
- Count number of errors/warnings per rollover and keep it in statistic
- Session/subscription display in proxy SC
- Message Queue in UI: Show peak and total amount of messages for queue
- Display server timeout and last activity in UI
- Make cache persistent on disk (its already the case bit it removes the files at startup/shutdown)
- SC client API isAttached() returns wrong information. Rename method or really check the SC state, how?
- Visualize the topologie of SC's and proxy's in the UI (its more a marketing then a functional point, verification of configuration)
- think about control stuff of proxies (layering, disabling cache on proxies etc)
- Turn on logging for a single service, separate file maybe.
- More statistic information per sever and service
- Support Web Services over SC (Axis / Metro)
- SSL/TLS/HTTPS implementation through SC

- Support for FIX protocol over SC www.fixprotocol.org
- Logging configuration for socket appender + Chainsaw
- OTI monitors the arrival of a message part, but not the completion of the entire large message. On Client the OTI monitors the whole message.
