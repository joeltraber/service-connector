SC Feature List

- Session/subscription display in proxy SC
- Message Queue in UI: Show peak and total amount of messages for queue
- Display server timeout and last activity in UI
- Make cache persistent on disk (its already the case bit it removes the files at startup/shutdown)
- SC client API isAttached() returns wrong information. Rename method or really check the SC state, how?
- Visualize the topologie of SC's and proxy's in the UI (its more a marketing then a functional point, verification of configuration)
- think about control stuff of proxies (layering, disabling cache on proxies etc)
- Turn on logging for a single service, separate file maybe.
- More statistic information per sever and service
- Support Webservices over SC
- SSL implementation through SC
